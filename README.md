# Scheduler
## Made by Vincent Ingrassia

This is an online scheduler desgined to change with the current time so the user knows what events they have coming up, missed, or might be late for. The user can enter data into the text boxs and click a save button so save it there. There is also a buttom to clear the data allowing the user to enter in new information.
